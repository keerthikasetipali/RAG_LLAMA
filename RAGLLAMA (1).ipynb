This note defines the purpose with which GeM has been envisioned. This stated \\npurpose shall play a key role in defining the strategy and operating model for GeM\\nKey elements from the note are as follows:\\nReason behind the GeM initiative\\nNeed for reform to bring consistency in public procurement\\nExisting malpractices in the system due to buyer-supplier interaction\\nFounding principles of GeM SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle to develop, manage and maintain the \\nGeM platform)\\nIncorporated as a Section 8 Company. Decision on public listing of GeM SPV to be taken\\nsubsequently.\\nAutonomous organization which is agile and has flexibility to take market driven decisions\\nThe organization shall break-even and self-sustain its operations from 3rd year onwards.\\nThe sources of monetization (charges to buyers and sellers) shall be kept to minimum, \\nenough to sustain running of SPV and pay Managed Service Provider (MSP)\\nFully accountable to tax payers and the Government\\nPromote inclusiveness and ease of doing business with the Government and its agencies\\nImpact that GeM is expected to deliver\\nIncrease access for procurement - broader outreach, wider variety of goods and services\\nIncrease transparency and efficiency (time & cost) of procurement\\nEncourage small business units/individuals to do business with the Government\\nMake procurement data easily available for auditors, administrators, vigilance etc.\\nIt is important to note that as the GeM platform and organization evolve, the founding \\nprinciples will also have to evolve.

The \\nspectrum of goods and services \\nprocured by the Government is \\nvery wide. The goods procured \\nby the Government range from \\nhighly standardized goods \\nlike A4 printing paper, printing \\ncartridges and electronic goods \\nlike printers and laptops to \\nhighly specialized goods like \\ndrilling equipment and medical \\nequipment. Similarly, for \\nservices, the spectrum ranges \\nfrom standard services such \\nas security services, chauffeur \\nservices and gardening services \\nto a more complex set of \\nspecialized services such \\nas consulting services and \\nengineering services.\\nWhile GeM shall seek to cater to \\nall the buyer needs for goods \\nand services that are commonly \\nused, it shall build its goods and services offering in a staged \\nmanner. GeM shall prioritize \\nthose goods and services to \\nbe supported in the short \\nterm that have a low level \\nof customization, are more \\nstandardized and have larger \\ntransaction volumes in the \\npublic procurement domain. \\nAs the GeM platform matures, \\nit shall support goods\\nand services requiring higher \\ndegree of complexity.\\nAt the same time, the GeM \\nplatform shall clearly define \\nthe set of goods and services \\nthat the platform shall \\nnever cater to constituting \\nthe exclusion list. This shall \\ninclude goods that are highly \\nspecialized and limited to very \\nniche buyer segment, such \\nas defence equipment, and \\nservices like mining services.\\nHow\\nThe GeM platform shall be \\nan open marketplace and \\nshall focus solely on being \\na platform for Government \\nbuyers to meet sellers and \\nconduct business. It shall \\nneither own the goods and \\nservices sold through the \\nplatform nor own the supply \\nand logistics of goods and \\nservices transacted on it. The \\nGeM platform shall be a trust-\\nbased portal where the buyer \\nshall hold the responsibility \\nto ensure value for money \\nand timely payment in any \\npurchase made and the seller \\nshall hold the responsibility \\nto ensure the accuracy and \\nintegrity of all information \\nshared, the quality of products \\nand services sold and the \\ntimeliness of the delivery.\\n10', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Since these policies \\nwere drafted in a time before GeM, they were \\nprimarily designed in accordance with the \\noffline procurement process and not with an \\nonline marketplace in mind. Thus, certain \\noperational design elements of these policies \\nmay not be entirely relevant on a standardized \\ntechnology-driven platform like GeM. With the \\nadvent of GeM, it is critical for the essence of \\nthese policies to be maintained and brought \\ntogether in a comprehensive marketplace \\nprocurement process that shall apply to all \\nprocurement on GeM. The GeM procurement \\nprocess is built on fundamental principles of public procurement i.e. transparency, value for \\nmoney and openness of competition. However, \\nby virtue of it being a technology-driven \\nplatform, the mechanism and processes by \\nwhich it achieves these objectives may change \\nfrom the past. \\nThus, a set of GeM procurement guidelines for \\noperating on GeM shall be drafted and shall \\napply to all buyers and sellers on the platform \\nindependent of the respective procurement \\npolicies applicable to them outside of the \\nplatform. For procurement made on GeM, \\nbuyers shall abide by the GeM procurement \\nguidelines and shall not be subject to \\ncompliance issues arising from different \\npolicies that may be applicable to them when \\nthey procure offline/outside GeM.\\n19', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This shall be designed in accordance with the premise that the user \\nwillingness to pay will be higher in big-ticket transactions. This shall also ensure higher \\nfeasibility of implementation and revenue realization for GeM. \\nGeM may also explore categorizing product and service categories basis their margin potential \\ninto buckets such as High, Medium, and Low margin potential. Higher margin categories may \\nbe charged a relatively higher % of the total transaction as there shall be higher willingness \\nto pay for sellers. \\nThus, a transaction fee matrix, clearly laying out the charges applicable on buyers and sellers \\nacross types of goods and services and across ranges of transaction value, shall be developed \\nand deployed on a periodic basis. This matrix shall be designed as per cost recovery \\nprinciples and shall be revised periodically depending on how revenue tracks against the \\ncosts.\\n2.5.2.1 Behavior-Based Incentives\\nRegistration Fees and Listing Fees shall serve as secondary revenue generation streams \\nwherein the primary aim of levying these charges shall be to drive right market behavior and \\nincentivize/disincentive the participants in line with the marketplace objectives.\\nA one-time registration fee for sellers shall help maintain the sanctity of the seller base and \\ndrive a sense of discipline in the registration process, prevent sellers from creating multiple, \\nunnecessary accounts and reduce the number of inactive sellers in the system since only \\nserious sellers register. Similarly, sellers shall be charged a small listing fee i.e. a fee for every \\ntime the seller wishes to list a new product or service.

GeM uses modern technology and enablers and brings together \\nall government buyers on a unified online platform for the procurement of commonly used \\ngoods and services. GeM reduces manual process inefficiencies in procurement and provides a \\npaperless and cashless e-marketplace with a streamlined, consistent process for all users.\\nThe nature of the platform is characterized by three core elements\\nOpenness: GeM shall be an open marketplace wherein it promotes access to information and \\ntransparency. Relevant information on sellers, products, and services shall be easy to find and \\nreadily available for both buyers and sellers. GeM shall provide data-based insights to help \\nusers in decision-making and ascertaining price reasonability.\\nFairness: One of GeM’s key objectives is to allow sellers, big and small, to gain direct access \\nto Government buyers. In doing so, GeM will ensure that all sellers are treated fairly. GeM \\nwill not offer preferential or promotional treatment to one seller over the other and shall \\nensure that all sellers are provided with a level playing field. This will ensure the health and \\ncompetitiveness of the marketplace.\\nInclusive: GeM promotes inclusion, which means that all Government buyers and sellers are \\naccepted on the platform. GeM aspires to create a robust seller base and all sellers interested \\nin conducting business with the Government shall be welcomed on the platform. For buyers \\nand sellers that do not have the know-how of using GeM, GeM shall provide additional \\nassistance in the form of focused training, onboarding sessions and continued feedback and \\nsupport.\\nIn the evolving procurement process in the country, it is useful to reiterate GeM’s role. GeM shall \\nnot be a managed marketplace but shall focus solely on being a platform for Government buyers \\nto meet sellers and conduct business. It shall neither own the goods and services sold through \\nthe platform nor own the supply and logistics of goods and services transacted on it. GeM shall \\nbe a trust-based portal where the buyer holds the responsibility to ensure value for money in any \\npurchase made and the seller holds the responsibility to ensure the accuracy and integrity of all \\ninformation shared. \\n5.2.2 Applicability\\nThese guidelines are issued in pursuant to Rule 149 of the General Financial Rules 2017. It has \\nbeen mandated as per GFR Rule 149 that if a product/service category is available on GeM, all \\nMinistries and Departments shall procure through GeM. Thereby, these guidelines shall apply \\nto all Central Ministries and Departments and the respective Central Public Sector Enterprises \\n(CPSEs) under them. These guidelines shall also be extended to States and the respective State \\nPublic Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between \\nGeM and the respective entity. The list of entities with which GeM has entered into a MoU shall \\nbe published on the website and will be continually updated. Thus, the mandate to procure from \\nGeM and the applicability of these guidelines shall also fall onto all buyers falling under the \\npurview of these entities.\\nAll other buyers like autonomous bodies, apex institutes, charities and other entities where \\n33•\\n•\\n•', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Since these policies were drafted in a time before GeM, they were \\nprimarily designed in accordance with the offline procurement process and not with an online \\nmarketplace in mind. Thus, certain operational design elements of these policies may not \\nbe entirely relevant on a standardized technology-driven platform like GeM. With the advent \\nof GeM, it is critical for the essence of these policies to be maintained and brought together \\nin a comprehensive marketplace procurement process and guidelines that shall apply to all \\nprocurement on GeM. The GeM procurement process is built on the fundamental principles \\nof public procurement: that of transparency, value for money and openness of competition. \\nHowever, by virtue of it being a technology-driven platform, the mechanism and processes by \\nwhich it achieves these objectives may change from the past.\\nThus, a set of GeM procurement guidelines for operating on GeM shall apply to all buyers and \\nsellers on the platform independent of the respective procurement policies applicable to \\nthem outside of the platform. For procurement made on GeM, buyers shall abide by the GeM \\nprocurement guidelines and shall not be subject to compliance issues arising from different \\npolicies that may be applicable to them when they procure offline/outside GeM.\\nSome of the indicative directives/processes that currently exist but are not relevant or \\nappropriate while transacting on the marketplace (GeM) include:\\n• Mandate for all Ministries and Departments to publish all tender enquiries and details of \\nbid awards on CPPP (Rule 159, Rule 201).\\n• Minimum three weeks time to be allowed for submission of bids (Rule 161).\\n• Procurement by Limited Tender Enquiry in cases of urgent need (Rule 162).\\n• Evaluation of technical bids to be conducted by Competent Authority or Technical \\nCommittee (Rule 163,164).\\n• Performance Security should be for an amount of five to ten percent of the value of the \\ncontract as specified in the bid documents (Rule 171).\\n• Procurement of services by Limited Tender Enquiry when the value of the services is less \\nthan 10 Lakhs (Rule 201). \\n5.2.4 GeM Procurement Guidelines\\nGeM has been established as the national procurement portal. Thereby, GeM shall seek to \\ndesign it’s procurement process and guidelines in adherence to the national level directives \\nfrom the Government. GeM will continuously look to new ways of supporting these policies \\nwhile adhering to the design principles intrinsic to GeM. All policies relating to various aspects \\nof GeM transactions are available on line and user feedback is inbuilt on the platform.\\nSome of the new processes and mechanisms by which GeM shall support the objectives of the \\ncentral directives have been detailed below:\\ni. Information visibility: Providing buyers with adequate information ensuring visibility for \\nMSE/local sellers and startups. Further, GeM will enable sellers to indicate the percentage of \\ndomestic content in their goods and services, promoting the Make in India order.\\nii. CPPP Integration: Ensuring real time sharing of information relating to all procurement \\nnotices and results.\\niii. Decision Support: Ratings on GeM provide complete information about buyers, sellers, and \\n34', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Monitoring and reporting: GeM shall provide buyers with dashboards and reports to monitor \\nthe trend of their procurement that may help them with adherence to the different directives.\\nv. Data based insights: The analysis of the transactional data on GeM may enable the \\npolicymakers from MSME and DIPP to recognize key challenges and review and revise \\nprocurement policies accordingly.\\nProcurement on GeM for all buying entities will be exclusively subject to the GeM guidelines, terms \\nand conditions as published by GeM on the GeM website, which shall override all concurrent \\nprocesses differing from or in conflict to the process outlined by GeM. GeM, being a technology-\\ndriven platform, has embedded certain facets of the procurement process in the design of the GeM \\nplatform. GeM shall provide requisite mechanisms needed to comply with the intent of the various \\nrelated procurement policies and guidelines defined by the different domain ministries. However, \\nit will be incumbent as buyers to ensure compliance with GeM’s guidelines, terms and conditions. \\nFor all circumstances not covered by the GeM guidelines, terms and conditions, the buyer should \\nadhere to the General Financial Rules and/or the procurement guidelines of the respective entity.\\nThese key facets have been detailed below. Detailed SOPs for the processes (as amended from \\ntime to time) shall be published on the GeM website.\\n5.2.4.1 Qualifications and credentials of Sellers/Service Providers\\nBy integrating with different Government databases and third-party entities, GeM shall provide \\nthe buyer with the credentials of the seller such as the financial credentials, preferential seller \\ncredentials such as registered MSE or startup and product or service assessment (Vendor \\nAssessment). GeM shall also provide a seller rating system that evaluates a seller’s performance on \\na continuous basis based on weightages to various parameters that capture quality, reliability and \\nactual performance. Thus, GeM provides a decision support system for qualifying seller credentials \\nby way of the different filters on the platform. GeM shall enable the buyers to customize the \\ncredentials needs as per their specific requirement. \\n5.2.4.2 Standardization of Technical Specifications/Parameters\\nThe technical specifications constitute a critical aspect of public procurement. One of the key \\nfacets of GeM is the standardization of these specifications/parameters. GeM shall provide \\nstandardized templates of technical parameters (TP), for both products and services, designed to \\nmaximize objectivity.\\nGeM shall ensure that these parameters are demand driven, market-aligned, consultative and \\ndynamic. Demand-driven means that these parameters will be designed keeping in mind the \\nbuyers’ requirements. Market aligned means that the parameters will be guided by market \\nknowledge and market trends.\\nConsultative means that GeM shall consult its buyers, sellers and the respective domain experts as \\nneeded to ensure that the TP is designed comprehensively. Dynamic means that GeM shall update \\nand revise the TP as per the changing needs of the buyer and the market.\\nThis standardization of parameters is the principal virtue of GeM that differentiates it from the \\nprevalent offline processes and systems. This lends itself to GeM being a fair, open and brand \\nagnostic platform. In addition, while procuring on GeM, buyers shall not need to invest the time \\n35', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

SoP for such upgrades and \\nupdates of TP of GeM catalog will be dynamic and evolving, without compromising on the need to \\nkeep GeM catalog generic at all times. \\n5.2.4.3 Price Reasonability\\nGeM shall provide the buyer with multiple tools to help the buyer ascertain price reasonability \\nsuch as comparison of prices across other e-commerce sites (wherever available), discount over \\nMRP, Last Purchase Price on GeM and the prices at which transactions have been conducted \\non GeM for similar items in the recent past. Buyers should also use the Last Purchase Price as \\nrecorded by the buying entity in ascertaining price reasonability. The responsibility to ascertain \\nthe reasonability of price for any buying on GeM rests solely with the buyer. Buyer will be \\nincentivized to contribute to the price rigor on the platform by sharing relevant information. \\n5.2.4.4 Modes of Procurement on GeM\\nAs mentioned earlier, for all products and services available on GeM, buyers must procure \\nthrough GeM. Since GeM aims to be a one-stop shop for buyers, buyers shall not be required to \\npublish or advertise the opportunity on any platform outside of GeM when procuring from GeM.\\nGeM supports three primary buying modes and the appropriate use of the buying mode shall \\nbe indicated by the platform as per the total value of the procurement. The three buying modes \\nsupported are Direct Purchase, Direct Purchase with L1 and e-bid/RA. Thus, all other procurement \\nmodes such as Purchase without Quotations or Purchase by Purchase Committee or Purchase \\nthrough Limited Tender Enquiry shall not be applicable for the products and services available on \\nGeM. Since inclusivity is one of the core elements of GeM, GeM shall not support purchase within \\na limited seller group. Maximizing the number of competing sellers will only result in better \\nprices for the buyer.\\nAs a marketplace, since all sellers receive real-time notifications when relevant bids are \\npublished, minimum period time of 10 days has been deemed sufficient. Similarly, for \\nperformance guarantee on GeM, the recommended value is 2% of the contract value. The lower \\namount of performance guarantee needed on GeM stems from the fact that GeM is a trust-based \\nsystem with multiple inbuilt systems enabling seller qualification as described previously. Also, \\nlowering the performance guarantee allows GeM to maximize inclusivity and the number of \\nsellers participating and reduce the overall cost of the transaction.\\n5.2.4.5 Procurement of Services\\nAs mentioned earlier, the standardization of parameters is a crucial facet of GeM and is a key \\nmechanism by which GeM enables the buyer to ascertain the quality for both products and \\nservices.\\n36', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In such cases, it may be important for the buyer to establish \\nrelevant work experience as a measure of quality.

It is essentially a book on material \\nscience. However, due to the complexity of gas turbines and their wider \\nappeal, it is of equal interest for both the material scientists and the \\nmechanical/aeronautical engineers involved in gas turbine development and maintenance. The monograph begins with a historical perspective of turbine development and covers some basic principles of jet propulsion and material science. However, the main emphasis remains on the high temperature gas turbine materials – their manufacturing from alloy to \\ncomponents, as well as their development and applications.\\nPages : 476\\nPrice: ` 1800/-\\n           US $36\\n           UK £31\\nTest Range: Evolution and Role in Weapon Development\\nPK Mahapatra\\nThis monograph introduces weapons with the necessary details to \\ncomprehend range functioning. It covers weapon types, complexities, payload delivery, propulsion systems, target neutralisation, safety, \\nreliability, life cycle, performance in extreme climates, and high-speed \\nimpacts. The book explores the attributes of an ideal Range and discusses qualitative and quantitative methods for assessing weapon performance. It delves into Range infrastructure, techniques, and the establishment of the Proof & Experimental Establishment (PXE), supported by visual aids such as photographs, tables, case studies, and anecdotes.\\nThis monograph serves as a valuable resource for scientists, engineers, \\nand professionals engaged in weapon design, development, production, quality assurance, and Range operations.

DRDO develops critical aero engine technology\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has established the near isothermal forging technology to produce all the five stages of high-pressure compressor (HPC) discs out of difficult-to-deform titanium alloy using its unique 2000 MT isothermal forge press.\\nThe technology has been developed by the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL), a premier metallurgical laboratory of DRDO at Hyderabad. This is a crucial technology for establishing self-reliance in aero engine technology. With this development, India has joined the league of limited global engine developers to have the manufacturing capabilities of such critical aero engine components, according to a statement.\\nTo meet the bulk production requirements, DMRL technology was transferred to MIDHANI through a licensing agreement for technology transfer (LAToT). As a result, using the isothermal forge press facility available at DMRL, bulk quantity (200 numbers) of HPC disc forgings of various compressor stages have been jointly produced and successfully supplied to HAL (E), Bengaluru for fitment in to Adour Engine that powers the Jaguar/Hawk Aircrafts.\\nIn India, the Adour engine is overhauled by HAL (E), Bengaluru, under a licensed manufacturing agreement with OEM. Like in any aero engine, the HPC Drum assembly has to be replaced after a specified number of operations or in case of damage. The annual requirements of these high-value HPC discs are pretty large, warranting indigenisation. HPC drum is a highly stressed sub-assembly and is also subjected to low cycle fatigue and creep at elevated temperature. The raw materials and forgings for the HPC drum must be of the highest quality, which can meet the specified combination of static and dynamic mechanical properties.\\nDMRL developed this forging technology by integrating various science and knowledge-based tools. The methodology adopted by DMRL is generic and can be tuned to create other similar aero engine components. The compressor discs produced using this methodology met all the requirements stipulated by the airworthiness agencies for the desired application. Accordingly, the technology was type certified, and a letter of technical approval (LoTA) was accorded. Based on the exhaustive component level and performance evaluation test results, HAL (E) and Indian Air Force cleared the components for engine fitment. Apart from DMRL and HAL (E), various agencies such as MIDHANI, CEMILAC and DGAQA worked in unison to establish this crucial technology.\\nRaksha Mantri Rajnath Singh congratulated the scientists of DRDO, Industry and all other agencies involved in developing this critical Aero Engine related technology.\\nSecretary Department of Defence R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy expressing happiness on achieving this crucial milestone, congratulated the teams involved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDRDO hands over technology to manufacture extreme cold weather clothing system to five industry partners\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has handed over to five Indian companies indigenously-developed technology for producing extreme cold-weather clothing for the armed forces. The technology was handed over as part of the government\\'s efforts to hand-hold Indian defence firms to produce high-quality products required by the armed forces.\\n\\n\\nChairman of DRDO G Satheesh Reddy handed over technology for indigenous extreme cold weather clothing system (ECWS) to five Indian companies on December 27,\" the defence ministry said.\\n\\n\\nIt said the ECWS is required by the Indian Army for its sustained operations in glacier and Himalayan peaks\\nTill recently, the Army has been importing extreme cold weather clothing and related items for the troops deployed in high altitude regions.\\n\\n\\n\"The DRDO designed ECWCS is an ergonomically designed modular technical clothing with improved thermal insulation and physiological comfort based on the insulation required at various ambient climatic conditions in Himalayan regions during different levels of physical activity,\" the ministry said in a statement.\\n\\n\\nIt said the three-layered ECWCS is designed to suitably provide thermal insulation over a temperature ranging from 15 degrees Celsius to minus 50 degree celsius.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRajnath lays foundation stone for two DRDO centres in Lucknow\\nBrahmos manufacturing centre is a modern, state-of-the-art facility, says Defence Ministry\\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday laid the foundation stone for a Defence Technology & Test Centre (DTTC) and a BrahMos manufacturing centre to be established by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in Lucknow.\\n“A first-of-its-kind Defence Technologies & Test Centre (DTTC), over approximately 22 acres is being set up to accelerate the growth of the defence and aerospace manufacturing clusters in Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor (UP DIC),” a Defence Ministry statement said.\\n\\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh hands over DRDO-developed products to Armed Forces\\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh handed over five products developed by DRDO to the Armed Forces and other security agencies at an event at DRDO Bhawan in New Delhi on Tuesday.\\nDefence Minister of India Rajnath Singh handed over five products developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to the Armed Forces and other security agencies at an event at DRDO Bhawan in New Delhi on Tuesday. He also handed over six Transfer of Technology (ToT) agreements to seven public and private sector companies. The event was part of the government’s Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations.\\nPRODUCTS HANDED OVER\\nRajnath Singh handed over the Smart Anti Airfield Weapon (SAAW), an air-launched, long-range, stand-off, air-to-surface smart bomb, to the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari.\\nThe variants of advanced chaff were handed over to the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral R Hari Kumar.\\nA structural fire-fighting suit developed by DRDO’s Centre for Fire, Explosive and Environment Safety (CFEES) in Delhi was handed over to V S K Kaumudi, Special Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Transfer of Technology documents of seven DRDO-developed systems were handed over. The seven systems include coastal surveillance radar, automatic chemical agent detection and alarm (ACADA) and chemical agent monitor (CAM), unit maintenance vehicle, unit repair vehicle, fused silica-based ceramic core technology and fire-suppressing gel.\\n‘READY TO MAKE STRONG DEFENCE INDUSTRIAL BASE’\\nAt a seminar titled ‘Preparing For The Future’ organised by DRDO on Tuesday, Rajnath Singh said, “There has been a big change over the last few years in the approach of DRDO. It is not only working on technologies to mitigate current threats but also on first-of-its-kind technologies to face future challenges.”\\nHe added that India can become a strong defence manufacturing base and exporter through collaboration between DRDO, the Armed Forces, private industry, start-ups and academia.\\n“The ToT with private players which took place today indicate that we are ready to make a strong defence industrial base in the country that will cater not only to domestic defence requirements but will also fulfill needs of friendly countries via defence item exports,” Rajnath Singh said.\\n\\n\\n\\nDRDO conducts maiden launch of indigenously developed new generation surface-to-surface missile ‘Pralay’  \\n\\n\\nDefence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully conducted maiden flight test of indigenously developed surface-to-surface missile ‘Pralay’, from Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha on December 22, 2021.

This ceremony is part of the three-day event ‘Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv’ in the city.\\nWHAT IS ‘SHAKTI’?\\nShakti, an advanced electronic warfare (EW) system has been designed and developed by the Defence Electronics Research Laboratory in Hyderabad, which is part of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).\\nIt has been designed for the Indian Navy’s capital warships for the purposes of interception, detection, classification, identification and jamming of conventional and modern radars.\\nThe Shakti system aims to provide an electronic layer of defence against modern radars and anti-ship missiles to ensure survivability in the maritime battlefield. This system will replace earlier generation EW systems of the Indian Navy.\\nThe system has been integrated with the wideband electronic support measures (ESM) and electronic counter measures for the defence of Indian Navy ships against missile attacks. The ESM of the system helps in finding accurate direction and interception of modern radars.\\nThe system has a built-in radar fingerprinting and data recording replay feature for post-mission analysis.\\nMAJOR MILESTONE: DEFENCE MINISTER\\nDefence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO, the Indian Navy and industry partners for the development of the Shakti system. He said, “This will enhance the capabilities of the Indian Navy. It is a major milestone towards Atmanirbhar Bharat in the areas of advanced defence technologies.”\\nThe first Shakti system has been installed on-board INS Visakhapatnam and is being installed on indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant.\\nTwelve Shakti systems are under production at Bharat Electronics Ltd, supported by more than fifty micro, small and medium enterprises at a total cost of Rs 1,805 crore. These systems are scheduled to be installed on-board capital warships under production, including P-15B, P-17A and Talwar class follow-on ships.\\n\\n\\n\\nDRDO displays drone swarm in offensive role\\nThe Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Wednesday showcased an indigenous capability to carry out offensive missions in enemy territory with scores of drones working in assorted formations to identify, encircle and strike targets, with the loitering munitions being developed to meet a key military requirement and keep soldiers out of harm’s way, officials familiar with the development said.\\nDefence minister Rajnath Singh during the inauguration of the three-day defence event in Jhansi, Wednesday. (PTI)\\nSurveillance and armed drone swarm figure on a new list of Make in India projects that the army plans to pursue in partnership with the industry. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane released the list last week while rooting for self-reliance in the defence sector and stressing that indigenous technology was key to victory in wars. The Indian Air Force is also fully backing the indigenous development of swarm drone technologies.\\nDRDO’s Young Scientist Laboratory for Asymmetric Technologies is working on swarm technologies to strengthen the country’s military capabilities, the DRDO said in a statement. “DRDO demonstrated a fully operational decentralised swarm of 25 drones flying with minimal human intervention,” it said.\\nThe capability demonstration came on the opening day of a three-day defence function in Jhansi linked to the ongoing countrywide celebrations to mark the 75th year of Independence.\\nThe event,which was inaugurated by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, seeks to highlight the government’s focus on achieving self-reliance in the defence sector, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to hand over locally produced military hardware, including the light combat helicopter, drones and electronic warfare systems, to the armed forces on November 19.\\nSingh said India was facing several challenges, ranging from border threats to sub-conventional ones such as terror and extremism. “There is a need to create a strong, modern and well-equipped military, along with an equally capable and self-reliant defence industry, which can provide low-cost yet top-quality equipment to our forces in a time-bound manner,” the minister added.\\nThe drone swarm showcased capabilities related to distributive sensing, decision making, reconfigurable path planning and autonomous attack, DRDO officials said, adding that swarm algorithms have advanced features for niche and distinctive capabilities.\\nUnmanned systems are best for “dull, dirty and dangerous missions” that a military may be required to carry out, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), who heads the Centre for Air Power Studies.\\n“Reconnaissance for long hours can be dull, exposure to nuclear contaminated zones can be dirty and areas with heavy enemy defences are dangerous. Drone swarms allow you to overwhelm the enemy’s sensors and weapons and hit multiple targets,” Chopra added.\\nThe Indian Army carried out a drone swarm technology demonstration at the Army Day-2021 parade in Delhi on January 15, with 75 locally designed and developed drones buzzing in the skies and simulating a raft of missions including offensive operations.\\nDrones within a swarm can carry out a wide range of missions including strikes against tanks, infantry combat vehicles, ammunition holding areas, fuel dumps and terror launch pads, officials have said.\\nThe technology demonstrated on January 15 is being developed by the army in partnership with a Bengaluru-based start-up New Space Research and Technologies, with the autonomous drones capable of sneaking 50km into enemy territory and striking targets with high-impact warheads. The drones can strike targets at a range of 100km in a self-destructive assault.\\nIndia is investing heavily into artificial intelligence, autonomous weapon systems, quantum technologies and robotics for a convergence between its war-fighting philosophies and military attributes of these technologies, the army previously said.\\nThe government is encouraging self-reliance is the defence manufacturing sector through several policy decisions including increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) limit from 49% to 74%, notifying 209 defence items that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware.\\nIndia has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹62,000 crore in the last two months to boost military capability with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons.\\nIndia has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.\\n\\nDRDO centre in UoH gets process patent for industrial burn rate enhancer\\n\\n\\nThe Advanced Centre of Research in High Energy Materials (ACRHEM), a DRDO Centre of Excellence in University of Hyderabad (UoH), has been granted a patent for process for synthesis of an industrial burn rate enhancer derivative\\nThe present patent entitled “Process for the Synthesis of 4-(dimethylsilane)-alkylferrocene” deals with the invention of a cost effective, simple and efficient synthetic process for the synthesis of 4-(dimethylsillane) butylferrocene, the UoH said on Wednesday.\\n\\nIt also offers a process for the synthesis of sructural variants of 4-(dimethylsilyl) alkylferrocene which can be easily scalable up to industrial scale, the University said.\\nThe inventors of patent were Prof. Tushar Jana of School of Chemistry, UoH and adjunct faculty in ACRHEM, and Dr. Bikash Kumar Sikder, who worked as a post-doctoral fellow in ACRHEM with Prof. Jana.\\nIAF-DRDO test smart anti-airfield weapon with 100-km range\\nThe indigenously-developed smart anti-airfield weapon (SAAW), which is a precision-guided bomb designed to destroy enemy runways, bunkers, aircraft hangers, radars and other reinforced structures at a maximum range of 100-km, has been tested twice by DRDO and IAF in recent days.\\n The first test of SAAW was carried out from an IAF aircraft at the Chandan ranges at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan on October 28, with the second one being conducted on Wednesday.\\n“Two different configurations based on satellite navigation and electro-optical sensors were successfully tested. The electro-optical seeker based flight-test of this class of bomb has been conducted for the first time in the country,” said a DRDO official.\\n“The electro-optical configuration of the system is equipped with imaging infra-red (IIR) seeker technology to enhance the precision strike capability of the weapon. In both the tests, the intended target was hit with high accuracy,” he added.\\nThe newly adapted launcher ensured smooth release and ejection of the weapon from the aircraft, with the advanced guidance and navigation algorithms and software performing as per the mission requirements. “The telemetry and tracking systems captured all mission events throughout the flight.

DRDO develops critical aero engine technology\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has established the near isothermal forging technology to produce all the five stages of high-pressure compressor (HPC) discs out of difficult-to-deform titanium alloy using its unique 2000 MT isothermal forge press.\\nThe technology has been developed by the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL), a premier metallurgical laboratory of DRDO at Hyderabad. This is a crucial technology for establishing self-reliance in aero engine technology. With this development, India has joined the league of limited global engine developers to have the manufacturing capabilities of such critical aero engine components, according to a statement.\\nTo meet the bulk production requirements, DMRL technology was transferred to MIDHANI through a licensing agreement for technology transfer (LAToT). As a result, using the isothermal forge press facility available at DMRL, bulk quantity (200 numbers) of HPC disc forgings of various compressor stages have been jointly produced and successfully supplied to HAL (E), Bengaluru for fitment in to Adour Engine that powers the Jaguar/Hawk Aircrafts.\\nIn India, the Adour engine is overhauled by HAL (E), Bengaluru, under a licensed manufacturing agreement with OEM. Like in any aero engine, the HPC Drum assembly has to be replaced after a specified number of operations or in case of damage. The annual requirements of these high-value HPC discs are pretty large, warranting indigenisation. HPC drum is a highly stressed sub-assembly and is also subjected to low cycle fatigue and creep at elevated temperature. The raw materials and forgings for the HPC drum must be of the highest quality, which can meet the specified combination of static and dynamic mechanical properties.\\nDMRL developed this forging technology by integrating various science and knowledge-based tools. The methodology adopted by DMRL is generic and can be tuned to create other similar aero engine components. The compressor discs produced using this methodology met all the requirements stipulated by the airworthiness agencies for the desired application. Accordingly, the technology was type certified, and a letter of technical approval (LoTA) was accorded. Based on the exhaustive component level and performance evaluation test results, HAL (E) and Indian Air Force cleared the components for engine fitment. Apart from DMRL and HAL (E), various agencies such as MIDHANI, CEMILAC and DGAQA worked in unison to establish this crucial technology.\\nRaksha Mantri Rajnath Singh congratulated the scientists of DRDO, Industry and all other agencies involved in developing this critical Aero Engine related technology.\\nSecretary Department of Defence R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy expressing happiness on achieving this crucial milestone, congratulated the teams involved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDRDO hands over technology to manufacture extreme cold weather clothing system to five industry partners\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has handed over to five Indian companies indigenously-developed technology for producing extreme cold-weather clothing for the armed forces. The technology was handed over as part of the government\\'s efforts to hand-hold Indian defence firms to produce high-quality products required by the armed forces.\\n\\n\\nChairman of DRDO G Satheesh Reddy handed over technology for indigenous extreme cold weather clothing system (ECWS) to five Indian companies on December 27,\" the defence ministry said.\\n\\n\\nIt said the ECWS is required by the Indian Army for its sustained operations in glacier and Himalayan peaks\\nTill recently, the Army has been importing extreme cold weather clothing and related items for the troops deployed in high altitude regions.\\n\\n\\n\"The DRDO designed ECWCS is an ergonomically designed modular technical clothing with improved thermal insulation and physiological comfort based on the insulation required at various ambient climatic conditions in Himalayan regions during different levels of physical activity,\" the ministry said in a statement.\\n\\n\\nIt said the three-layered ECWCS is designed to suitably provide thermal insulation over a temperature ranging from 15 degrees Celsius to minus 50 degree celsius.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4309, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.4764397600256104)], metadata={'dcbaa68b-9d80-4dbd-8eb8-fede77979b95': {'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'NL_February2024.pdf', 'file_path': '/home/kavita/Desktop/autogen/LLM/ex2/data/NL_February2024.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1706789, 'creation_date': '2024-07-25', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-06'}, '0eb67ad1-5304-4212-bd2c-b41cb72cfee3': {'file_path': '/home/kavita/Desktop/autogen/LLM/ex2/data/kk.txt', 'file_name': 'kk.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 29817, 'creation_date': '2024-07-25', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-06'}})"

(PTI)\\nSurveillance and armed drone swarm figure on a new list of Make in India projects that the army plans to pursue in partnership with the industry. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane released the list last week while rooting for self-reliance in the defence sector and stressing that indigenous technology was key to victory in wars. The Indian Air Force is also fully backing the indigenous development of swarm drone technologies.\\nDRDO’s Young Scientist Laboratory for Asymmetric Technologies is working on swarm technologies to strengthen the country’s military capabilities, the DRDO said in a statement. “DRDO demonstrated a fully operational decentralised swarm of 25 drones flying with minimal human intervention,” it said.\\nThe capability demonstration came on the opening day of a three-day defence function in Jhansi linked to the ongoing countrywide celebrations to mark the 75th year of Independence.\\nThe event,which was inaugurated by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, seeks to highlight the government’s focus on achieving self-reliance in the defence sector, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to hand over locally produced military hardware, including the light combat helicopter, drones and electronic warfare systems, to the armed forces on November 19.\\nSingh said India was facing several challenges, ranging from border threats to sub-conventional ones such as terror and extremism. “There is a need to create a strong, modern and well-equipped military, along with an equally capable and self-reliant defence industry, which can provide low-cost yet top-quality equipment to our forces in a time-bound manner,” the minister added.\\nThe drone swarm showcased capabilities related to distributive sensing, decision making, reconfigurable path planning and autonomous attack, DRDO officials said, adding that swarm algorithms have advanced features for niche and distinctive capabilities.\\nUnmanned systems are best for “dull, dirty and dangerous missions” that a military may be required to carry out, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), who heads the Centre for Air Power Studies.\\n“Reconnaissance for long hours can be dull, exposure to nuclear contaminated zones can be dirty and areas with heavy enemy defences are dangerous. Drone swarms allow you to overwhelm the enemy’s sensors and weapons and hit multiple targets,” Chopra added.\\nThe Indian Army carried out a drone swarm technology demonstration at the Army Day-2021 parade in Delhi on January 15, with 75 locally designed and developed drones buzzing in the skies and simulating a raft of missions including offensive operations.\\nDrones within a swarm can carry out a wide range of missions including strikes against tanks, infantry combat vehicles, ammunition holding areas, fuel dumps and terror launch pads, officials have said.\\nThe technology demonstrated on January 15 is being developed by the army in partnership with a Bengaluru-based start-up New Space Research and Technologies, with the autonomous drones capable of sneaking 50km into enemy territory and striking targets with high-impact warheads. The drones can strike targets at a range of 100km in a self-destructive assault.\\nIndia is investing heavily into artificial intelligence, autonomous weapon systems, quantum technologies and robotics for a convergence between its war-fighting philosophies and military attributes of these technologies, the army previously said.\\nThe government is encouraging self-reliance is the defence manufacturing sector through several policy decisions including increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) limit from 49% to 74%, notifying 209 defence items that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware.\\nIndia has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹62,000 crore in the last two months to boost military capability with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons.\\nIndia has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget.
