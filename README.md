# RAG Question Answering System with LLaMA

This repository contains the implementation of a **Question Answering System** using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with the **LLaMA model**. The system allows users to input questions and receive contextually relevant answers by leveraging pre-existing documents for enhanced accuracy.


## Overview

This project integrates **LLaMA** with the **RAG framework** to create a powerful question-answering system. The system retrieves context from external documents (PDF, text files, etc.) and generates accurate, context-aware answers. 

By leveraging RAGâ€™s capabilities, this system retrieves relevant text snippets from documents and generates natural language answers using a fine-tuned LLaMA model. It is particularly useful for large collections of documents where precision in answering queries is important.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval-based search with generative models.
- **Customizable Document Set**: Upload your own documents to customize the QA system.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Generates answers that are informed by relevant document context.
- **LLaMA Integration**: Leverages LLaMA's strong generative capabilities for high-quality answers.
- **Support for Various File Formats**: Allows retrieval from PDFs, text files, and other supported formats.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-llama-qa-system.git
   cd rag-llama-qa-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Ensure you have the necessary API keys (e.g., Hugging Face, Groq) set up in your `.env` file.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Upload Documents**:
   Use the web interface or predefined paths to upload or reference documents from which the system will retrieve relevant information.

3. **Ask Questions**:
   Enter your questions, and the system will generate answers based on the documents provided.

4. **Response**:
   The system retrieves the most relevant passages from the documents and generates a natural language answer using the LLaMA model.

## Configuration

- **API Keys**: Store necessary API keys (e.g., Hugging Face, Groq, OpenAI) in a `.env` file. Example:
   ```bash
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_hf_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```
